    "## Interpretation\n",
    "The persistence of conditional heteroskedasticity in the EGARCH(1,1) residuals indicates that a portion of the volatility structure remains unexplained by the current specification. This residual dependence may arise from unmodeled **higher-order dynamics**, **nonlinear asymmetries**, or **microstructural effects** (e.g., volume–volatility feedback, liquidity shocks, intraday periodicities).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, the analytical trajectory bifurcates depending on the modeling objective:\n",

    "1. **Statistical Purism (Model Completeness)**  \n",
    "   If the goal is to achieve *variance whiteness* — a residual process that is i.i.d. with zero conditional heteroskedasticity — the natural direction is to explore higher-order or alternative volatility models:  \n",

    "   $$  \n",
    "   The objective is to absorb remaining ARCH effects and minimize the Ljung–Box and ARCH–LM test statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction (Volatility as Signal)**  \n",
    "   If the EGARCH output is to serve within a *meta-model* or *feature ensemble*, the residual heteroskedasticity can be considered **informational rather than pathological**.  \n",
    "   The conditional variance series and standardized residuals encapsulate *volatility regimes*, *shock clustering*, and *nonlinear persistence* — features that may be exploited by higher-capacity learners (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers, or ensemble models).  \n",
    "   In this context, residual variance patterns represent latent state information about market microdynamics rather than model misspecification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, whether residual heteroskedasticity is treated as **noise to be eliminated** or **structure to be learned** depends on the epistemic stance of the modeling pipeline —  \n",
    "the distinction between *closing the model* and *opening the signal*.\n"
